# Sprite-Viewer

A tool for making "objects" and "map objects" and saving it to a .objects or .mapobjects file that can be read and used within a game.
The application uses Wxwidgets for the UI, SFML for rendering and handling the sprite and FileHandler's functions for reading the files.

You can find a example folder with a Pac-Man object inside and a Battle City tank that is ready to be loaded by the application.
